WinGitBashScripts
=================

A list of git bash scripts that I use on Windows for Git Bash /bin/bash

Copy all these files to /bin/, or Program Files\Git\bin\ or C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin

You may need to copy the files with explorer as an administrator or use notepad++ which uses administrative privileges.


Note: Some of these scripts will work in *nix, just remember to use dos2unix to convert them
